# About This Repository: Extracting Categorical Feature Embeddings using DeepFM

## Overview

Welcome to this GitHub repository focused on leveraging DeepFM for extracting meaningful feature embeddings from categorical data. DeepFM combines the best of factorization machines and deep learning, making it a powerful tool for capturing both low- and high-order feature interactions. The notebook in this repo aims to provide a comprehensive guide, including basic code and some  documentation, to generate and utilize categorical feature embeddings for various real-world applications.

## Why Categorical Feature Embeddings?

Categorical variables are often tricky to handle, especially when they are high-cardinality or when they have a complex relationship with the target variable. Traditional techniques like one-hot encoding may not capture these intricacies. Feature embeddings offer a nuanced way to represent categorical variables, enabling advanced analytics and predictive modeling.

## Who Is This For?

- **Data Scientists**: Looking to enhance their feature engineering techniques.
- **Machine Learning Engineers**: Interested in implementing advanced models for categorical data.
- **Industry Professionals**: In sectors like insurance, healthcare, and finance, where understanding the feature importance and relationships is crucial.
- **Data Enthausiasts**: Just wanna try some methods out 

## What's Inside?

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Step-by-step guide with toy example to get you started
- **Documentation**: Explanation of the methods, including how to evaluate the effectiveness of embeddings.
- **Use-Cases**: Practical applications demonstrating how to use these embeddings for tasks like risk assessment, customer segmentation, and more.
