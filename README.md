# Extracting Categorical Feature Embeddings using DeepFM

## Overview

Welcome to this GitHub repository focused on leveraging DeepFM for extracting meaningful feature embeddings from categorical data. DeepFM combines the best of factorization machines and deep learning, making it a powerful tool for capturing both low- and high-order feature interactions. The notebook in this repo aims to provide a starting guide, including basic code and some  documentation, to generate and utilize categorical feature embeddings for various real-world applications.

## Why Categorical Feature Embeddings?

Categorical variables are often tricky to handle, especially when they are high-cardinality or when they have a complex relationship with the target variable. Traditional techniques like one-hot encoding may not capture these intricacies. Feature embeddings offer a nuanced way to represent categorical variables, enabling advanced analytics and predictive modeling.

## Who Is This For?

- **Data Scientists**: Looking to enhance their feature engineering techniques.
- **Machine Learning Engineers**: Interested in implementing advanced models for categorical data.
- **Industry Professionals**: In sectors like insurance, healthcare, and finance, where understanding the feature importance and relationships is crucial.

## About DeepFM

Deep Factorization Machines (DeepFM) is a hybrid algorithm that combines the merits of Factorization Machines (FMs) and Deep Neural Networks. It's designed to handle both low- and high-order feature interactions, making it a popular choice for complex tasks involving categorical variables.

### What Makes DeepFM Unique?

1. **Factorization Machines (FM) Component**: This part is tailored to capture low-order or linear feature interactions. It's particularly good for handling sparse data and high-cardinality categorical features.
  
2. **Deep Neural Network Component**: This part captures high-order and complex feature interactions, giving the model its ability to understand intricate patterns in the data.

3. **Shared Input**: Both the FM and Deep components share the same input, allowing the model to learn both low- and high-level feature interactions simultaneously.

### Why DeepFM in this Repository?

In the context of this repository, DeepFM serves as an advanced tool for capturing complex relationships among categorical variables, which are then transformed into feature embeddings. These embeddings can significantly improve the performance and interpretability of downstream machine learning tasks.
